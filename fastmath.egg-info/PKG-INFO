        ### Prerequisites
        
        Nothing For Now
        
        ### Installation
        
        * pip3 install fastmath
        
        ## Usage
        
        To add numbers do: `add(1, 2)`
        
        This is the same as 1 + 2
        
        To subtract do: `sub(2, 3)`
        
        This is the same as 2 - 3
        
        To multiply do: `mul(2, 2)`
        
        This is the same as 2 * 2
        
        To divide do:`div(4, 2)`
        
        This is the same as 4 / 2
        
        To caculate the area of a circle do:
        
        `circle_area(5)`
        
        This is the same as 5^2 * 3.14
        
        To use the quadratic formula do:
        
        `qudratic(6, 17, 12)`
        
        This is the same as (-17 (+ or -) sqrt(17^2 - 4 * 6 * 12)) / 2 * 6
        
        To do factorial:
        
        `fac(2)`
        
        This is the same as !2
        
        To do natural logarithm:
        
        `ln(2)`
        
        
        To do square root:
        
        `sqrt(4)`
        
        This is the same as √4
        
        To do sine:
        
        `sin(45)`
        
        To do cosine:
        
        `cos(45)`
        
        To do tangent:
        `tan(45)`
        
        
        To do cotangent:
        `cot(45)`
        
        To do cosecant:
        `csc(45)`
        
        To do secant:
        
        `sec(45)`
