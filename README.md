### Prerequisites

Numpy

### Installation

* pip3 install fastmath

## Usage

To add numbers do: `add(1, 2)`

This is the same as 1 + 2

To subtract do: `sub(2, 3)`

This is the same as 2 - 3

To multiply do: `mul(2, 2)`

This is the same as 2 * 2

To divide do:`div(4, 2)`

This is the same as 4 / 2

To caculate the area of a circle do:

`circle_area(5)`

This is the same as 5^2 * 3.14

To use the quadratic formula do:

`qudratic(6, 17, 12)`

This is the same as (-17 (+ or -) sqrt(17^2 - 4 * 6 * 12)) / 2 * 6

To do factorial:

`fac(2)`

This is the same as !2

To do natural logarithm:

`ln(2)`


To do square root:

`sqrt(4)`

This is the same as √4

To do sine:

`sin(45)`

To do cosine:

`cos(45)`

To do tangent:
`tan(45)`


To do cotangent:
`cot(45)`

To do cosecant:
`csc(45)`

To do secant:

`sec(45)`
